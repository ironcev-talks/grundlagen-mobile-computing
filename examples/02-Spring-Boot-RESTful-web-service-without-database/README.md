## Conceptual Simplifications

- The REST API is not documented. The [Spring REST Docs](https://spring.io/projects/spring-restdocs) is not used.
- The mapping from domain objects to DTOs is done manually. Mapping frameworks are not used. See: [Performance of Java Mapping Frameworks](https://www.baeldung.com/java-performance-mapping-frameworks)
- The API is not secured. [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) is not used.
